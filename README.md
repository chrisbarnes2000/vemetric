## About

Vemetric is an open-source web and product analytics platform that helps you understand your users' behavior. It's designed to be simple yet powerful, providing insights into how users interact with your website or product.

## Features

- Real-time analytics
- Behavior tracking via User Journeys
- Custom event tracking
- Powerful filtering mechanisms to see how your users interact with your Product & Website
- Tracking across several subdomains

## Self hosting

We're planning on supporting self hostable options of Vemetric in the future as a so called "Community Edition". It's still very early and we're currently focused on higher prioritized tasks.

We aren't sure yet which features will be available in the Community Edition, but it will definitely cover Web Analytics (everything you get in the [Dashboard](https://vemetric.com/docs/dashboard)), as well as [User Journeys](https://vemetric.com/docs/product-analytics/user-journeys).
