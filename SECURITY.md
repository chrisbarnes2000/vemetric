# Security Policy

## Security Updates

We aim to fix any known vulnerability as soon as possible. When a security vulnerability is discovered:

1. We will assess the severity and impact
2. For critical vulnerabilities, we will release a patch as soon as possible
3. For non-critical vulnerabilities, we will include fixes in the next planned release

When we support self-hosted versions of Vemetric in the future, we'll notify users about new versions that fix critical vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any security-related issues, please follow these steps:

1. Please act responsibly and **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. Email us at info@vemetric.com with:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)
3. We will keep you updated on our progress in addressing the issue
